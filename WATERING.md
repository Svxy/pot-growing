<h1 align="center">How much plants should be watered</h1>

<img src="https://github.com/Svxy/Pot-Growing/blob/grow/assets/watering.png?raw=true">

<p>The amount of water plants need depends on these factors;</p>

- Size of the plant
- Area temperature
- Overall growth
- Stage of plant growth

<br>

<p>You want to water a plant enough to soak all the soil in the pot. Water should pool up on the surface of the soil when you’re watering, and come out the drainage holes in the bottom of the pot after a couple seconds. If water sits on the surface of the soil, that means it’s too wet and doesn’t need more water.

If a weed plant is very dry, water will run straight through the soil and pot and quickly come out the drainage holes. If this happens, water the plant a little bit and then come back to it after 15-20 minutes and water it again, and maybe even a third time. This allows the soil to slowly absorb water until all of it is thoroughly wet.

Roots are constantly on the hunt for water as they grow and stretch out. As a plant gets bigger, so should the watering radius—the area around the stalk of the plant that you water. Doing this will help guide roots to the edges of the pot as they seek available nutrients in soil.

Watering too far away from the roots can create standing water, which can lead to root rot, mold, and pest issues.</p>

<p>Getting the right container size;</p>

<br>

<p>To properly water a cannabis plant, it needs to be in the correct size container, or a big enough hole if it’s in the ground. If a pot is too big, the plant’s roots can’t drink water where they don’t reach. If the roots aren’t absorbing water, water will sit in soil and take a long time to evaporate, which can promote root rot and unwanted insects and fungus.

Conversely, if a container is too small, the roots won’t be able to stretch out, which can stunt the growth of a plant. Less soil also meant you’ll need to water the plant all the time, which will add labor.

Ideally, cannabis plants should start in a small pot and progress to bigger and bigger pots as they outgrow each container. For example, you can start a seedling or clone in a 4″ or 1-gallon pot, then move on to a 2-gallon, 5-gallon, 10-gallon, and so on.

Plants are ready to transplant when a healthy root structure encompasses most of the soil and the roots aren’t bound. When transplanting, take time to look at the quality of the roots: Bright white roots with a strong, thick structure is a sign plants are getting watered correctly.</p>

<p>When to stop watering before harvest;</p>

<br>

<p>Water your marijuana plants as normal when in the flushing phase—don’t let them get too dry or too wet. Make sure not to harvest dry or wilting weed plants—they should be nice and healthy when you cut them down.</p>
